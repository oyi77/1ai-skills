# Money-Making Overview

This pipeline converts leads into cash. Each stage advance increases deal probability: NEW (5%) → CONTACTED (10%) → QUALIFIED (25%) → DEMO (40%) → PROPOSAL (60%) → NEGOTIATION (80%) → CLOSED_WON (100%). Moving 10 leads through the full pipeline per month at $2K average deal size = $20K monthly revenue.



## When Not to Use

- **Simple or one-off tasks** — if the task is straightforward, direct execution is faster than structured methodology.
- **Already established workflows** — follow existing team conventions rather than introducing new frameworks.
- **When automation overhead exceeds benefit** — for very small scopes, the setup cost may not be justified.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 18+
- Access to relevant APIs/services for your specific use case
- Basic understanding of the domain concepts


## Commands

```bash
# Refer to the skill's usage section for specific commands
# Adapt these to your workflow
```
## Revenue Streams

1. **Your Own Sales ($2K-20K/deal)** — Close your own services through the pipeline
2. **Pipeline-as-a-Service ($1K-5K/mo)** — Manage pipeline for clients: import their leads, qualify, track stages, generate proposals
3. **Sales Analytics ($500-2K/mo)** — Pipeline reporting as a service: weekly reports, conversion analysis, revenue forecasts for other businesses

## First Action in 60 Minutes

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Pipeline audit: measure current stage distribution
echo "=== Pipeline Audit ==="
echo "Leads by stage:"
echo "  NEW: $(sqlite3 ~/1ai-social/data.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_leads WHERE stage="NEW"' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
echo "  QUALIFIED: $(sqlite3 ~/1ai-social/data.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_leads WHERE stage="QUALIFIED"' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
echo "  PROPOSAL: $(sqlite3 ~/1ai-social/data.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_leads WHERE stage="PROPOSAL"' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
echo "  CLOSED_WON: $(sqlite3 ~/1ai-social/data.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_leads WHERE stage="CLOSED_WON"' 2>/dev/null || echo 0)"
echo ""
echo "Revenue target for this month: \$X"
echo "Deals needed at 60% proposal stage: X"
```

## Architecture

Sales is built INTO 1ai-social as MCP tools (prefixed `sales_`).

```
1ai-social MCP Server (75 tools total)
├── Marketing tools (55) — content, social, engagement, growth
├── 1ai-engage tools — cold outreach pipeline
└── Sales tools (20) — lead → qualify → propose → close
```

## Pipeline Stages — The Money Funnel

```
NEW → CONTACTED → QUALIFIED → DEMO → PROPOSAL → NEGOTIATION → CLOSED_WON
 🔍      📞          📋        🎯      📄          💬           🤝
                                                           └──▶ CLOSED_LOST ❌
```

| Stage | Win Probability | Money Mindset |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| NEW | 5% | Cold. Needs qualification or drop. |
| CONTACTED | 10% | They know you exist. Get on their radar. |
| QUALIFIED | 25% | Budget, authority, need, timeline confirmed. Real deal. |
| DEMO | 40% | They saw value. Now prove it solves their problem. |
| PROPOSAL | 60% | Halfway there. Don't stall — follow up within 24h. |
| NEGOTIATION | 80% | Price objections. Hold value, offer options. |
| CLOSED_WON | 100% | Money in the bank. Ask for referrals. |

## MCP Tools (20 sales_ tools)

### Lead Management (Capture Every Prospect)

- `sales_add_lead` — Add new lead
- `sales_list_leads` — List with stage/grade filters
- `sales_get_lead` — Full details + activities + proposals
- `sales_update_lead` — Update fields

### Qualification (Filter Tire-Kickers)

- `sales_qualify_lead` — BANT qualification (auto-advances when all 4 confirmed)

**BANT Checklist:**
- **B**udget — Can they afford it? Do they have a budget allocated?
- **A**uthority — Are they the decision maker? Can they sign?
- **N**eed — Do they clearly need what you offer? Is it a priority?
- **T**imeline — When do they want to buy? Is there urgency?

A lead is qualified only when ALL 4 criteria are confirmed. Do not advance unqualified leads — they waste your pipeline capacity.

## Workflow: 1ai-engage → Sales (Convert Cold to Cash)

```
1. engage_list_leads(status='replied')     → get warm leads
2. sales_add_lead(source='engage', ...)    → import to pipeline
3. sales_qualify_lead(budget=True, ...)    → BANT qualify
4. sales_advance_lead()                    → move through stages
5. sales_generate_proposal_template()      → generate proposal
6. sales_create_proposal() → sales_send_proposal()
7. sales_schedule_follow_up()              → track follow-ups
8. sales_pipeline_report()                 → analytics
```

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Truth |
|--------|-------|
| "Pipeline is empty this month" | Start with 10 cold outreaches RIGHT NOW |
| "I need more tools" | You have 20 tools; use them |
| "Deals always stall at proposal" | Follow up within 24h or lose the deal |
| "Cold outreach does not work" | It works when personalized and targeted. Generic spam does not. |
| "I will follow up later" | 80% of sales require 5+ follow-ups. Follow up consistently. |
| "Price is the only factor" | Value, trust, and timing matter more than price. Sell outcomes. |
