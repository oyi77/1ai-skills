# Marketing Ops — AI CMO for Solo Founders

One AI-powered system that runs your entire marketing & sales operation
so you can focus on building product. 4-layer architecture with shared
context, auto-chaining orchestrator, and feedback loops that learn.

```

**Critical principle:** Every mode ends with DOING, not just MAKING.
The execution engine auto-reviews every draft against quality gates
(brand voice, personalization, CTA, spam check, platform fit).
If it passes → auto-execute. If it fails → flag for human review.
Read `references/execution-engine.md` for the full auto-review framework.

## First Use: Start Here

Say `/marketing-ops setup`. The onboarding guide (`references/onboarding.md`)
walks you through an interactive conversation:

1. **Business Identity** (2 min) — name, product, ICP, differentiator
2. **Brand Voice** (1 min) — personality, tone, formality level
3. **Stage Assessment** (1 min) — MRR, customers, current channels
4. **Auto-Send Setup** (5 min) — configure Gmail auto-sender
5. **Lead Sources** (2 min) — where to find prospects

Generates: `marketing-profile.yml`, `brand-voice.md`, `persona.md`
Then recommends your first actions based on your stage.

If unsure where to start, say `/marketing-ops help` for guided paths.

## Feedback Loop

When user shares results:
1. Record what was tested and what happened
2. Identify the insight (why it worked/failed)
3. Apply forward to next similar task
4. Suggest updating Layer 1 files if learning is significant

---

## Adaptive Behavior

- **Language:** Generate in profile/user language
- **Stage:** Recommendations filtered by MRR stage
- **Industry:** Tone, compliance, channels adapt to industry
- **Funnel:** Content tagged TOFU/MOFU/BOFU/Post-purchase
- **Framework auto-select:** PAS for ads, AIDA for landing pages, BAB for
  case studies, PASTOR for long-form sales

---

## Scripts & Templates

**Scripts** (`scripts/`):
- `content_calendar.py` — CSV content calendar
- `ad_calculator.py` — Ad spend & ROI projections
- `seo_audit.py` — SEO audit report template
- `unit_economics.py` — LTV, CAC, payback, PLG funnel calculator

**Templates** (`templates/`):
- `marketing-profile.yml` — Business context (Layer 1)
- `brand-voice.md` — Voice guidelines
- `persona.md` — Audience persona
- `review-template.md` — Weekly/monthly/quarterly review + OKRs

---

## Quick Start

```
/marketing-ops setup          # 5-min onboarding (do this once)
/marketing-ops stage          # What should I focus on right now?
/marketing-ops daily          # Full auto-pilot: draft → review → SEND
```

### Setup Auto-Send (One-Time, 10 Minutes)

The skill auto-reviews every draft. To make it also auto-SEND,
set up one of these (see execution-engine.md for full instructions):

1. **Google Apps Script** (free) — auto-sends any Gmail draft with
   "[AUTO-SEND]" in the subject. Skill adds the prefix, script sends it.
2. **MailerLite MCP** (connect from MCP registry) — direct send for
   email sequences and campaigns.
3. **Zapier/Make** — "new draft with label → send → delete draft"

### After Setup: The Fully Autonomous Daily Routine

```
/marketing-ops daily

→ AI searches web for 10-15 prospects matching your ICP
→ AI auto-qualifies and picks top 5 (scored against persona.md)
→ AI finds their email/contact (pattern matching + web research)
→ AI drafts personalized outreach for each prospect
→ AI self-reviews against 8-point quality gate
→ Passed emails auto-sent via [AUTO-SEND] (zero clicks)
→ Failed emails held as drafts for your review
→ Follow-ups auto-sent on schedule (Day 3, Day 7 breakup)
→ Hot lead replies auto-responded with calendar link
→ Social posts prepared, ads optimized, pipeline tracked
→ You get a summary: "5 sent, 2 follow-ups, 1 demo booked"

YOUR TIME: 3 minutes reading summary + demo calls.
AI does: prospecting, researching, writing, reviewing, sending.
```

## How to Use

1. Define campaign objective and target KPIs
2. Set up tracking and attribution (UTMs, pixels, events)
3. Create campaign assets (copy, creatives, landing pages)
4. Launch with small budget for testing
5. Monitor metrics daily, optimize underperformers
6. Scale winners, pause losers, document learnings

## When NOT to Use

- Task is about sales, not marketing (use sales skills)
- Task is about product development (use product skills)
- You need to analyze marketing data (use analytics skills)
- Task is about customer support (use support skills)
- You don't have marketing assets
- Task requires legal review (consult legal)


## Red Flags

- **Metrics declining 3+ days**: Investigate funnel leaks or audience fatigue
- **Ad spend with zero conversions**: Pause and review targeting/creative
- **Email open rates below 15%**: Subject lines or sender reputation issue
- **Bounce rate above 70%**: Landing page mismatch or slow load times
- **Attribution gaps**: Missing UTM parameters or broken tracking pixels

## Verification

- Run A/B test with control group before full rollout
- Verify tracking pixels fire correctly on all conversion pages
- Check UTM parameters parse correctly in analytics dashboard
- Confirm email deliverability via seed list test
- Validate landing page speed (target < 3s load time)
