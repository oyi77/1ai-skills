## Money-Making Overview

| Service | Client Price | Your Time | Monthly Recurring |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Marketing audit + setup (1x) | $1,500–$3,000 | 8–15 hrs | No |
| Marketing ops retainer (weekly) | $1,000–$2,500/mo | 4–8 hrs/wk | Yes |
| Full-stack marketing automation | $3,000–$5,000/mo | 10–20 hrs/wk | Yes |
| Growth consulting + execution | $5,000–$10,000/mo | 20–30 hrs/wk | Yes |

**Target clients:** Solo founders, pre-seed/seed startups, e-commerce brands, and agencies who need a full marketing operation without hiring a CMO + team.

**Buyer persona:** Founder generating $5K–$100K/mo who knows they need marketing but doesn't have time to execute. They have a product, some revenue, but zero marketing infrastructure — no tracking, no funnel, no content system.

**First dollar timeline:** Week 1 — audit + quick wins (fix tracking, set up one channel). Month 1 — first campaign live + leads coming in. Month 3 — full flywheel running.

## Core Architecture

4-layer system that runs on auto-pilot:

**Layer 1 — Shared Context Layer**
- Customer profiles, ICP, brand voice, competitor file, keyword map
- Single source of truth every campaign reads from
- Updated weekly from performance data

**Layer 2 — Orchestrator (Auto-Chaining)**
- Week planning → daily execution → performance review
- Each completed task triggers the next (research → create → publish → analyze)
- No manual handoffs between stages

**Layer 3 — Execution Layer**
- Content creation (blog, social, video, email)
- Channel distribution (scheduling, posting, DMs)
- Ad buying & optimization
- Email sequences (nurture, sales, retention)

**Layer 4 — Feedback Layer**
- Daily: engagement metrics, ad spend, email stats
- Weekly: pipeline review, CAC by channel, content performance
- Monthly: full funnel audit, strategy pivot recommendations

## Deliverable Format

```markdown
# Marketing Operations Audit & Proposal

## Client: [Name]
## Prepared: [Date]
## Engagement: [One-time / Retainer / Full-Stack]

---

## 1. Executive Summary
- Current state: channels active, revenue, traffic, conversion rate
- Key gaps: missing tracking, low conversion, no content system, no retention
- Opportunity: estimated lift from fixing gaps (X% increase)
- Recommendation: three-phase plan (quick wins → system → scale)

## 2. Audit Findings

| Area | Current State | Gap | Priority |
|------|--------------|-----|----------|
| Tracking | [e.g., No UTM] | [e.g., Can't attribute] | Critical |
| Content | [e.g., 1 blog/mo] | [e.g., No content engine] | High |
| Email | [e.g., No list] | [e.g., No nurture] | High |
| Paid Ads | [e.g., Untested] | [e.g., No data] | Medium |
| SEO | [e.g., 5 articles] | [e.g., No keyword strategy] | Medium |
| Retention | [e.g., No follow-up] | [e.g., High churn] | Critical |

## 3. Quick Wins (Week 1)
1. Fix tracking — UTM parameters + analytics dashboard
2. Email capture — popup + welcome sequence

| Phase | Deliverables | Price | Timeline |
|-------|-------------|-------|----------|
| Audit + Setup | Tracking, analytics, quick wins | $1,500–$3,000 | Week 1 |
| Monthly Retainer | Content, ads, email, optimization | $2,000–$5,000/mo | Ongoing |
| Full-Stack | Everything above + partnerships, CRO | $5,000–$10,000/mo | Ongoing |

```

---

## When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "marketing ops"
- "Help me with marketing ops"
- "set up marketing automation"
- "build a marketing system"
- "I need marketing for my startup"

**Use cases:**
- Solo founders who need a marketing system but can't hire a team
- Pre-seed/seed startups needing first 100 customers
- E-commerce brands needing multi-channel marketing
- Agencies who want to outsource marketing execution
- Indonesia/SEA businesses needing localized marketing

**When NOT to use:**
- When the audience is too small to justify the effort (< 100 potential customers)
- For regulated industries without compliance review (healthcare, finance)
- When the campaign budget does not support the channel (< $500/mo ad budget)
- For tasks that need deep vertical expertise (enterprise sales, biotech)
- When the client needs a CMO strategist, not an executor

---

## Workflow

```python
# Example: SEO keyword analysis
def analyze_keywords(keywords: list[str]) -> list[dict]:
    results = []
    for kw in keywords:
        volume = get_search_volume(kw)
        difficulty = get_difficulty(kw)
        results.append({
            "keyword": kw,
            "volume": volume,
            "difficulty": difficulty,
            "opportunity": volume / max(difficulty, 1),
        })
    return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x["opportunity"], reverse=True)
```

1. **Research** — Analyze market, competitors, and audience
2. **Strategy** — Define goals, channels, and messaging
3. **Create** — Develop content and creative assets
4. **Launch** — Deploy campaigns across channels
5. **Optimize** — A/B test and iterate based on data
6. **Report** — Track KPIs and ROI

---

## Key Metrics

- Reach and impressions
- Engagement rate (likes, shares, comments)
- Conversion rate (clicks → leads → customers)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Return on ad spend (ROAS)
- Lead velocity (leads/week growth)
- Pipeline velocity (days from lead to close)
- Net revenue retention / churn

---

## Best Practices

- Test everything — headlines, images, CTAs, timing
- Focus on one channel at a time, then expand
- Build organic before scaling paid
- Track attribution across the full funnel
- Document every campaign — what worked, what didn't, why
- Automate everything that doesn't need human judgment
- Refresh content on a 90-day cycle
- Price by value delivered, not hours worked

---

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll set up tracking later" | Without tracking, every dollar is a guess. Day 1 or never. |
| "I can't afford marketing yet" | You can't afford NOT to market. One paying customer funds your system. |
| "I need a perfect strategy first" | Speed beats perfection. Launch, measure, iterate. A bad campaign teaches more than no campaign. |
| "My product sells itself" | No product sells itself. Marketing is how people find out you exist. |
| "SEO takes too long" | SEO is a 6-month exponential curve. Day 1 is the cheapest it will ever be. |
| "I don't have time to manage marketing" | That's what a retainer is for. You focus on product; I run the system. |
| "Paid ads are too expensive" | Wrong creative is expensive. Right creative with proper tracking prints money at $5/day. |

---

## Process

1. **Research** — Analyze target audience, competitors, and trending topics
2. **Create** — Generate content following brand guidelines and best practices
3. **Publish & Optimize** — Distribute to target platforms, track performance, iterate
