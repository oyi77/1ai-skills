description: 'Uses Rekall memory forensics framework to analyze memory dumps for process hollowing, injected code via VAD
  anomalies, hidden processes, and rootkit detection. Applies plugins like pslist, psscan, vadinfo, malfind, and dlllist to
  extract forensic artifacts from Windows memory images. Use during incident response memory analysis.

# Extracting Memory Artifacts with Rekall


## When to Use

- When performing authorized security testing that involves extracting memory artifacts with rekall
- When analyzing malware samples or attack artifacts in a controlled environment
- When conducting red team exercises or penetration testing engagements
- When building detection capabilities based on offensive technique understanding

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Use Rekall to analyze memory dumps for signs of compromise including process
injection, hidden processes, and suspicious network connections.

```python
from rekall import session
from rekall import plugins

# Create a Rekall session with a memory image
s = session.Session(
    filename="/path/to/memory.raw",
    autodetect=["rsds"],
    profile_path=["https://github.com/google/rekall-profiles/raw/master"]
)

# List processes
for proc in s.plugins.pslist():
    print(proc)

# Detect injected code
for result in s.plugins.malfind():
    print(result)
```

Key analysis steps:
1. Load memory image and auto-detect profile
2. Run pslist and psscan to find hidden processes
3. Use malfind to detect injected/hollowed code in process VADs
4. Examine network connections with netscan
5. Extract suspicious DLLs and drivers with dlllist/modules

## Examples

```python
from rekall import session
s = session.Session(filename="memory.raw")
# Compare pslist vs psscan for hidden processes
pslist_pids = set(p.pid for p in s.plugins.pslist())
psscan_pids = set(p.pid for p in s.plugins.psscan())
hidden = psscan_pids - pslist_pids
print(f"Hidden PIDs: {hidden}")
```
## When NOT to Use

- You need to analyze extracted data (use analyzing-* skills)
- Task is about detecting extraction (use detecting-* skills)
- You need to implement extraction tools (use implementing-* skills)
- Task is about building extraction infrastructure (use building-* skills)
- You don't have access to forensic images
- Task requires chain of custody (follow forensic process)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Failing to use write-blockers when acquiring forensic evidence
- Not verifying hash integrity before and after imaging
- Modifying original evidence during analysis
## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- Hash values computed and verified match between source and image
- Chain of custody log complete with timestamps and examiner names
- Analysis tools and versions documented for reproducibility
