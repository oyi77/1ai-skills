# Testing For Open Redirect Vulnerabilities

## Overview

Cybersecurity skill for testing for open redirect vulnerabilities. Follows industry best practices and security standards.

## When to Use
**Trigger phrases:**
- "testing for open redirect vulnerabilities"
- "Identify and test open redirect vulnerabilities in web applications by analyzing"

- When testing login/logout flows that redirect users to specified URLs
- During assessment of OAuth authorization endpoints with redirect_uri parameters
- When auditing applications with URL parameters (next, url, redirect, return, goto, target)
- During phishing simulation to chain open redirects with credential harvesting
- When testing SSO implementations for redirect validation weaknesses


## When NOT to Use

- When you lack proper authorization for testing
- For production systems without change management
- When the task requires legal or compliance expertise beyond technical scope


## Prerequisites
- Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP for intercepting redirect requests
- Collection of open redirect bypass payloads
- External domain or Burp Collaborator for redirect confirmation
- Understanding of URL parsing and encoding schemes
- Browser with developer tools for observing redirect chains
- Knowledge of HTTP 301/302/303/307/308 redirect status codes


> **Legal Notice:** This skill is for authorized security testing and educational purposes only. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have written permission to test is illegal and may violate computer fraud laws.

## Workflow

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. **Reconnaissance** — Gather information about the target related to . Identify attack surface.
2. **Vulnerability Identification** — Enumerate potential  weaknesses using automated and manual techniques.
3. **Exploit Development/Selection** — Use open redirect vulnerabilities to identify and test  vulnerabilities.
4. **Execution** — Execute the  test in a controlled manner with proper authorization.
5. **Post-Exploitation** — Document the impact and extent of successful exploitation.
6. **Reporting** — Write detailed findings with reproduction steps, impact assessment, and remediation guidance.

## Tools

- **open redirect vulnerabilities** — Primary tool for this skill
- **Vulnerability Scanner** — Automated weakness identification
- **Exploitation Framework** — Controlled exploitation testing
- **Reporting Tool** — Findings documentation and tracking

## Verification

- [ ] All  procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
