description: Analyze WAF (ModSecurity/AWS WAF/Cloudflare) logs to detect SQL injection attack campaigns. Parses ModSecurity
  audit logs and JSON WAF event logs to identify SQLi patterns (UNION SELECT, OR 1=1, SLEEP(), BENCHMARK()), tracks attack
  sources, correlates multi-stage injection attempts, and generates incident reports with OWASP classification.

# Detecting SQL Injection via WAF Logs


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require detecting sql injection via waf logs
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
2. Collect WAF logs (ModSecurity audit log, AWS WAF JSON logs, or Cloudflare firewall events).
3. Run the agent to parse and analyze:
   - Detect SQLi payloads via 15+ regex patterns
   - Classify attacks by OWASP injection type (classic, blind, time-based, UNION-based)
   - Identify persistent attackers by IP clustering
   - Correlate multi-request injection campaigns
   - Calculate attack success probability based on response codes

```bash
python scripts/agent.py --log-file /var/log/modsec_audit.log --format modsecurity --output sqli_report.json
```

## Examples

```bash
# Basic usage example
# Replace with domain-specific commands from the workflow above
```
### ModSecurity SQLi Detection
```
Rule 942100 triggered: SQL Injection Attack Detected via libinjection
URI: /api/users?id=1' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users--
Source IP: 203.0.113.42 (47 requests in 5 minutes)
Classification: UNION-based SQLi campaign
```
## When NOT to Use

- You need to perform the attack to test detection (use performing-* skills)
- Task is about analyzing past incidents (use analyzing-* skills)
- You need to implement detection rules (use implementing-* skills)
- Task is about threat hunting proactively (use hunting-* skills)
- You don't have access to logs or monitoring data
- Task requires incident response (use IR skills)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Exceeding the authorized scope of the engagement
- Leaving persistent access mechanisms without explicit approval
- Causing denial-of-service on production systems during testing
## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- All exploited vulnerabilities documented with reproduction steps
- Scope boundaries confirmed — only authorized targets were tested
- Remediation recommendations included for every finding
