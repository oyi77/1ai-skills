# Hunting For Dcsync Attacks

## When to Use

- When hunting for DCSync credential theft (MITRE ATT&CK T1003.006)
- After detecting Mimikatz or similar tools in the environment
- During incident response involving Active Directory compromise
- When monitoring for unauthorized domain replication requests
- During purple team exercises testing AD attack detection

## Prerequisites

- Windows Security Event Log forwarding enabled (Event ID 4662)
- Audit Directory Service Access enabled via Group Policy
- Domain Computers SACL configured on Domain Object for machine account detection
- SIEM with Windows event data ingested (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel)
- Knowledge of legitimate domain controller accounts and replication partners

## Workflow

1. **Define Detection Scope** — Identify the specific  techniques or indicators to hunt. Map to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques where applicable.
2. **Collect Baseline Data** — Gather historical logs and establish normal behavior patterns for .
3. **Build Detection Queries** — Write dcsync attacks queries targeting  indicators. Use platform-specific query language for optimal performance.
4. **Execute Hunts** — Run queries against the collected data, starting with broad filters and narrowing down.
5. **Triage Results** — Investigate alerts, filter false positives, and validate findings against known-good behavior.
6. **Document Findings** — Record confirmed detections, IOCs, and affected systems. Update detection rules based on findings.

## Tools

- **dcsync attacks** — Primary tool for this skill
- **SIEM Platform** — Central log aggregation and query execution
- **Sigma Rules** — Vendor-agnostic detection rule format
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** — Technique mapping and coverage analysis

## Verification

- [ ] All  procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization
