# Performing Timeline Reconstruction With Plaso

## Overview

Cybersecurity skill for performing timeline reconstruction with plaso. Follows industry best practices and security standards.

## When to Use
**Trigger phrases:**
- "performing timeline reconstruction with plaso"
- "Build comprehensive forensic super-timelines using Plaso (log2timeline) to corre"

- When building a comprehensive forensic timeline from multiple evidence sources
- For correlating events across file system metadata, event logs, browser history, and registry
- During complex investigations requiring chronological reconstruction of activities
- When standard log analysis is insufficient to establish the sequence of events
- For presenting investigation findings in a visual, chronological format


## When NOT to Use

- When you lack proper authorization for testing
- For production systems without change management
- When the task requires legal or compliance expertise beyond technical scope


## Prerequisites
- Plaso (log2timeline/psort) installed on forensic workstation
- Forensic disk image(s) in raw (dd), E01, or VMDK format
- Sufficient storage for Plaso output (can be 10x+ the image size)
- Minimum 8GB RAM (16GB+ recommended for large images)
- Timeline Explorer (Eric Zimmerman) or Timesketch for visualization
- Understanding of timestamp types (MACB: Modified, Accessed, Changed, Born)

## Workflow

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. **Plan Operations** — Define objectives, scope, and success criteria for timeline reconstruction operations.
2. **Prepare Environment** — Set up tools, access, and data sources required for timeline reconstruction.
3. **Execute Core Workflow** — Use plaso to perform timeline reconstruction operations following established procedures.
4. **Validate Results** — Verify that results meet quality standards and objectives.
5. **Report Findings** — Document results, observations, and recommendations.
6. **Follow Up** — Track remediation actions and verify fixes where applicable.

## Tools

- **plaso** — Primary tool for this skill
- **Analysis Platform** — Data processing and visualization
- **Collaboration Tools** — Team coordination and knowledge sharing


## Process

1. **Design** — Define interface, identify patterns, plan implementation
1. **Implement** — Write code following existing conventions, add tests
1. **Verify** — Run tests, check integration, validate behavior

## Verification

- [ ] All timeline reconstruction procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
