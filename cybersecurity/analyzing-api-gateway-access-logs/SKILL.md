description: 'Parses API Gateway access logs (AWS API Gateway, Kong, Nginx) to detect BOLA/IDOR attacks, rate limit bypass,
  credential scanning, and injection attempts. Uses pandas for statistical analysis of request patterns and anomaly detection.
  Use when investigating API abuse or building API-specific threat detection rules.

# Analyzing API Gateway Access Logs


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing api gateway access logs
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

Parse API gateway access logs to identify attack patterns including broken object
level authorization (BOLA), excessive data exposure, and injection attempts.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_json("api_gateway_logs.json", lines=True)
# Detect BOLA: same user accessing many different resource IDs
bola = df.groupby(["user_id", "endpoint"]).agg(
    unique_ids=("resource_id", "nunique")).reset_index()
suspicious = bola[bola["unique_ids"] > 50]
```

Key detection patterns:
1. BOLA/IDOR: sequential resource ID enumeration
2. Rate limit bypass via header manipulation
3. Credential scanning (401 surges from single source)
4. SQL/NoSQL injection in query parameters
5. Unusual HTTP methods (DELETE, PATCH) on read-only endpoints

## Examples

```python
# Detect 401 surges indicating credential scanning
auth_failures = df[df["status_code"] == 401]
scanner_ips = auth_failures.groupby("source_ip").size()
scanners = scanner_ips[scanner_ips > 100]
```
## When NOT to Use

- You need to perform the attack, not analyze it (use performing-* skills)
- Task is about detection, not analysis (use detecting-* skills)
- You need to implement controls (use implementing-* skills)
- Task is about threat hunting, not post-incident analysis (use hunting-* skills)
- You don't have access to the artifacts/logs to analyze
- Task requires real-time monitoring (use SOC tools)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Exceeding the authorized scope of the engagement
- Leaving persistent access mechanisms without explicit approval
- Causing denial-of-service on production systems during testing
## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- All exploited vulnerabilities documented with reproduction steps
- Scope boundaries confirmed — only authorized targets were tested
- Remediation recommendations included for every finding
