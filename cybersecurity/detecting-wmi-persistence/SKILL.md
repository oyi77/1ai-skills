# Detecting Wmi Persistence

## Overview

Cybersecurity skill for detecting wmi persistence. Follows industry best practices and security standards.

## When to Use

- When hunting for WMI event subscription persistence (MITRE ATT&CK T1546.003)
- After detecting suspicious WMI activity in endpoint telemetry
- During incident response to identify attacker persistence mechanisms
- When Sysmon alerts trigger on Event IDs 19, 20, or 21
- During purple team exercises testing WMI-based persistence


## When NOT to Use

- When you lack proper authorization for testing
- For production systems without change management
- When the task requires legal or compliance expertise beyond technical scope


## Prerequisites

- Sysmon v6.1+ deployed with WMI event logging enabled (Event IDs 19, 20, 21)
- Windows Security Event Log forwarding configured
- SIEM with Sysmon data ingested (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel)
- PowerShell access for WMI enumeration on endpoints
- Sysinternals Autoruns for manual WMI subscription review

## Workflow

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. **Define Detection Scope** — Identify the specific wmi persistence techniques or indicators to hunt. Map to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques where applicable.
2. **Collect Baseline Data** — Gather historical logs and establish normal behavior patterns for wmi persistence.
3. **Build Detection Queries** — Write detection rules, Sigma rules, or SIEM queries targeting wmi persistence indicators.
4. **Execute Hunts** — Run queries against the collected data, starting with broad filters and narrowing down.
5. **Triage Results** — Investigate alerts, filter false positives, and validate findings against known-good behavior.
6. **Document Findings** — Record confirmed detections, IOCs, and affected systems. Update detection rules based on findings.

## Tools

- **SIEM Platform** — Central log aggregation and query execution
- **Sigma Rules** — Vendor-agnostic detection rule format
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** — Technique mapping and coverage analysis

## Verification

- [ ] All wmi persistence procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
