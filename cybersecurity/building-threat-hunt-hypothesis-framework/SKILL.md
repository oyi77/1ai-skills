# Building Threat Hunt Hypothesis Framework

## Overview

Cybersecurity skill for building threat hunt hypothesis framework. Follows industry best practices and security standards.

## When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "building threat hunt hypothesis framework"
- "When proactively hunting for indicators of building threat hunt hypothesis frame"
- "After threat intelligence indicates active campaigns using these techniques"
- "During incident response to scope compromise related to these techniques"


- When proactively hunting for indicators of building threat hunt hypothesis framework in the environment
- After threat intelligence indicates active campaigns using these techniques
- During incident response to scope compromise related to these techniques
- When EDR or SIEM alerts trigger on related indicators
- During periodic security assessments and purple team exercises


## When NOT to Use

- When you lack proper authorization for testing
- For production systems without change management
- When the task requires legal or compliance expertise beyond technical scope


## Prerequisites

- EDR platform with process and network telemetry (CrowdStrike, MDE, SentinelOne)
- SIEM with relevant log data ingested (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel)
- Sysmon deployed with comprehensive configuration
- Windows Security Event Log forwarding enabled
- Threat intelligence feeds for IOC correlation

## Workflow

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. **Assess Requirements** — Evaluate current environment and define threat hunt hypothesis framework implementation requirements.
2. **Design Architecture** — Plan the threat hunt hypothesis framework architecture, including components, integrations, and data flows.
3. **Configure Components** — Set up and configure each threat hunt hypothesis framework component according to best practices.
4. **Test Integration** — Validate that all components work together. Run functional and security tests.
5. **Deploy to Production** — Roll out the implementation with monitoring and rollback capabilities.
6. **Validate and Document** — Verify the implementation meets requirements. Document configuration and runbooks.

## Tools

- **Configuration Management** — Infrastructure as code and automation
- **Monitoring Stack** — Observability and alerting
- **Documentation Platform** — Runbooks and architecture docs


## Process

1. **Reconnaissance** — Gather target information, identify attack surface, enumerate services
1. **Analysis/Exploitation** — Execute the technique, analyze results, document findings
1. **Reporting** — Document IOCs, write findings, provide remediation recommendations

## Verification

- [ ] All threat hunt hypothesis framework procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
