# Hunting For Data Exfiltration Indicators

## When to Use

- When hunting for data theft in compromised environments
- After detecting unusual outbound data volumes or patterns
- When investigating potential insider threat data theft
- During incident response to determine what data was stolen
- When threat intel indicates data exfiltration campaigns targeting your sector

## Prerequisites

- Network proxy/firewall logs with byte-level data transfer metrics
- DLP solution or CASB with cloud upload visibility
- DNS query logs for DNS exfiltration detection
- Email gateway logs for attachment monitoring
- SIEM with data volume anomaly detection capabilities

## Workflow

1. **Define Detection Scope** — Identify the specific  techniques or indicators to hunt. Map to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques where applicable.
2. **Collect Baseline Data** — Gather historical logs and establish normal behavior patterns for .
3. **Build Detection Queries** — Write data exfiltration indicators queries targeting  indicators. Use platform-specific query language for optimal performance.
4. **Execute Hunts** — Run queries against the collected data, starting with broad filters and narrowing down.
5. **Triage Results** — Investigate alerts, filter false positives, and validate findings against known-good behavior.
6. **Document Findings** — Record confirmed detections, IOCs, and affected systems. Update detection rules based on findings.

## Tools

- **data exfiltration indicators** — Primary tool for this skill
- **SIEM Platform** — Central log aggregation and query execution
- **Sigma Rules** — Vendor-agnostic detection rule format
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** — Technique mapping and coverage analysis

## Verification

- [ ] All  procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization
