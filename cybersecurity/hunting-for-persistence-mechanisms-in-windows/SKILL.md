# Hunting For Persistence Mechanisms In Windows

## When to Use

- During periodic proactive threat hunts for dormant backdoors
- After an incident to identify all persistence mechanisms an attacker planted
- When investigating unusual services, scheduled tasks, or startup entries
- When threat intel reports describe new persistence techniques in the wild
- During security posture assessments to identify unauthorized persistent software

## Prerequisites

- Sysmon deployed with Event IDs 12/13/14 (Registry), 19/20/21 (WMI), 1 (Process Creation)
- Windows Security Event forwarding for 4697 (Service Install), 4698 (Scheduled Task)
- EDR with registry and file monitoring capabilities
- PowerShell script block logging enabled (Event ID 4104)
- Autoruns or equivalent baseline of legitimate persistent entries

## Workflow

1. **Define Detection Scope** — Identify the specific  techniques or indicators to hunt. Map to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques where applicable.
2. **Collect Baseline Data** — Gather historical logs and establish normal behavior patterns for .
3. **Build Detection Queries** — Write persistence mechanisms in windows queries targeting  indicators. Use platform-specific query language for optimal performance.
4. **Execute Hunts** — Run queries against the collected data, starting with broad filters and narrowing down.
5. **Triage Results** — Investigate alerts, filter false positives, and validate findings against known-good behavior.
6. **Document Findings** — Record confirmed detections, IOCs, and affected systems. Update detection rules based on findings.

## Tools

- **persistence mechanisms in windows** — Primary tool for this skill
- **SIEM Platform** — Central log aggregation and query execution
- **Sigma Rules** — Vendor-agnostic detection rule format
- **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** — Technique mapping and coverage analysis

## Verification

- [ ] All  procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization
