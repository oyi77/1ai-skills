# Performing Steganography Detection

## Overview

Cybersecurity skill for performing steganography detection. Follows industry best practices and security standards.

## When to Use
**Trigger phrases:**
- "performing steganography detection"
- "Detect and extract hidden data embedded in images, audio, and other media files "

- When suspecting covert data hiding in images, audio, or video files
- During investigations involving suspected data exfiltration via media files
- For analyzing files in espionage or insider threat investigations
- When standard file analysis reveals anomalies in media file properties
- For detecting communication channels using steganographic techniques


## When NOT to Use

- When you lack proper authorization for testing
- For production systems without change management
- When the task requires legal or compliance expertise beyond technical scope


## Prerequisites
- StegDetect, zsteg, stegsolve, binwalk for analysis
- steghide, OpenStego for extraction attempts
- ExifTool for metadata analysis
- Python with Pillow, numpy for custom analysis
- Understanding of common steganographic techniques (LSB, DCT, spread spectrum)
- Sample files for comparison and statistical analysis

## Workflow

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. **Plan Operations** — Define objectives, scope, and success criteria for steganography detection operations.
2. **Prepare Environment** — Set up tools, access, and data sources required for steganography detection.
3. **Execute Core Workflow** — Perform the steganography detection operations following established procedures.
4. **Validate Results** — Verify that results meet quality standards and objectives.
5. **Report Findings** — Document results, observations, and recommendations.
6. **Follow Up** — Track remediation actions and verify fixes where applicable.

## Tools

- **Analysis Platform** — Data processing and visualization
- **Collaboration Tools** — Team coordination and knowledge sharing

## Verification

- [ ] All steganography detection procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
