# Hunting For Webshell Activity

## When to Use

- When proactively hunting for indicators of hunting for webshell activity in the environment
- After threat intelligence indicates active campaigns using these techniques
- During incident response to scope compromise related to these techniques
- When EDR or SIEM alerts trigger on related indicators
- During periodic security assessments and purple team exercises

## Prerequisites

- EDR platform with process and network telemetry (CrowdStrike, MDE, SentinelOne)
- SIEM with relevant log data ingested (Splunk, Elastic, Sentinel)
- Sysmon deployed with comprehensive configuration
- Windows Security Event Log forwarding enabled
- Threat intelligence feeds for IOC correlation

## Workflow

1. **Formulate Hypothesis**: Define a testable hypothesis based on threat intelligence or ATT&CK gap analysis.
2. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine which logs and telemetry are needed to validate or refute the hypothesis.
3. **Execute Queries**: Run detection queries against SIEM and EDR platforms to collect relevant events.
4. **Analyze Results**: Examine query results for anomalies, correlating across multiple data sources.
5. **Validate Findings**: Distinguish true positives from false positives through contextual analysis.
6. **Correlate Activity**: Link findings to broader attack chains and threat actor TTPs.
7. **Document and Report**: Record findings, update detection rules, and recommend response actions.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| T1505.003 | Web Shell |
| T1190 | Exploit Public-Facing Application |
| T1059.001 | PowerShell |

## Tools & Systems

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| CrowdStrike Falcon | EDR telemetry and threat detection |
| Microsoft Defender for Endpoint | Advanced hunting with KQL |
| Splunk Enterprise | SIEM log analysis with SPL queries |
| Elastic Security | Detection rules and investigation timeline |
| Sysmon | Detailed Windows event monitoring |
| Velociraptor | Endpoint artifact collection and hunting |
| Sigma Rules | Cross-platform detection rule format |

## Common Scenarios

1. **Scenario 1**: China Chopper web shell via IIS vulnerability
2. **Scenario 2**: ASPXSpy through vulnerable upload
3. **Scenario 3**: PHP shell hidden in image file
4. **Scenario 4**: JSP shell via Tomcat manager console

## When NOT to Use

- You're responding to a known incident (use IR skills)
- Task is about analyzing confirmed malware (use analyzing-* skills)
- You need to implement detection rules (use implementing-* skills)
- Task is about vulnerability scanning (use scanning tools)
- You don't have access to endpoint/network data
- Task requires compliance auditing (use auditing-* skills)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Exceeding the authorized scope of the engagement
- Leaving persistent access mechanisms without explicit approval
- Causing denial-of-service on production systems during testing

## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- Vulnerabilities reproduced with proof-of-concept and impact analysis
- False positives filtered out through manual verification
- Fix recommendations include code-level remediation guidance
