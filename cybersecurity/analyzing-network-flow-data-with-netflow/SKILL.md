description: Parse NetFlow v9 and IPFIX records to detect volumetric anomalies, port scanning, data exfiltration, and C2 beaconing
  patterns. Uses the Python netflow library to decode flow records, builds traffic baselines, and applies statistical analysis
  to identify flows with abnormal byte counts, connection durations, and periodic timing patterns.

# Analyzing Network Flow Data with Netflow


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing network flow data with netflow
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with network security concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install netflow`
2. Collect NetFlow/IPFIX data from routers or use the built-in collector: `python -m netflow.collector -p 9995`
3. Parse captured flow data using `netflow.parse_packet()`.
4. Analyze flows for:
   - Port scanning: single source to many destinations on same port
   - Data exfiltration: high byte-count outbound flows to unusual destinations
   - C2 beaconing: periodic connections with consistent intervals
   - Volumetric anomalies: traffic spikes beyond baseline thresholds
5. Generate a prioritized findings report.

```bash
python scripts/agent.py --flow-file captured_flows.json --output netflow_report.json
```

## Examples

```bash
# Capture and analyze network traffic
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap -c 10000
```
### Parse NetFlow v9 Packet
```python
import netflow
data, _ = netflow.parse_packet(raw_bytes, templates={})
for flow in data.flows:
    print(flow.IPV4_SRC_ADDR, flow.IPV4_DST_ADDR, flow.IN_BYTES)
```
## When NOT to Use

- You need to perform the attack, not analyze it (use performing-* skills)
- Task is about detection, not analysis (use detecting-* skills)
- You need to implement controls (use implementing-* skills)
- Task is about threat hunting, not post-incident analysis (use hunting-* skills)
- You don't have access to the artifacts/logs to analyze
- Task requires real-time monitoring (use SOC tools)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Capturing traffic on networks without authorization or privacy considerations
- Leaving packet captures containing sensitive data unencrypted on disk
- Deploying inline blocking rules without testing for false positives first
## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- Captures verified as complete with no dropped packets
- Detection rules tested against known-benign traffic for false positive rate
- Alert thresholds validated and tuned to reduce noise
