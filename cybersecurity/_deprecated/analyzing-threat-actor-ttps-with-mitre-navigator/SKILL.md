# Analyzing Threat Actor TTPs with MITRE Navigator

## Overview

The MITRE ATT&CK Navigator is a web application for annotating and visualizing ATT&CK matrices.
Combined with the attackcti Python library (which queries ATT&CK STIX data via TAXII), analysts
can programmatically generate Navigator layer files mapping specific threat group TTPs, compare
multiple groups, and assess detection coverage gaps against known adversaries.


## When to Use
**Trigger phrases:**
- "analyzing threat actor ttps with mitre navigator"
- "Map advanced persistent threat (APT) group tactics, techniques, and procedures ("


- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing threat actor ttps with mitre navigator
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques


## When NOT to Use

- When you lack proper authorization for testing
- For production systems without change management
- When the task requires legal or compliance expertise beyond technical scope


## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ with attackcti and stix2 libraries installed
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator (web UI or local instance)
- Understanding of STIX 2.1 objects and relationships

## Steps

1. Query ATT&CK STIX data for target threat group using attackcti
2. Extract techniques associated with the group via STIX relationships
3. Generate ATT&CK Navigator layer JSON with technique annotations
4. Overlay detection coverage to identify gaps
5. Export layer for team review and defensive planning

## Expected Output

```json
{
  "name": "APT29 TTPs",
  "domain": "enterprise-attack",
  "techniques": [
    {"techniqueID": "T1566.001", "score": 1, "comment": "Spearphishing Attachment"},
    {"techniqueID": "T1059.001", "score": 1, "comment": "PowerShell"}
  ]
}
```
## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Acting on threat intelligence without validating source reliability
- Sharing classified or sensitive indicators without proper handling procedures
- Alerting threat actors to detection capabilities through visible response actions

## Process

1. **Scope** — Define research questions, identify data sources, set time boundaries
1. **Gather** — Collect data from primary sources, APIs, and public records
1. **Synthesize** — Analyze findings, identify patterns, produce actionable report

## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- Results validated against known-good baselines or reference implementations
- Documentation complete enough for another analyst to reproduce findings

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
