# Implementing Deception-Based Detection with Canarytoken

## Overview

Canary Tokens are lightweight tripwire mechanisms that alert when an attacker accesses a resource. This skill uses the Thinkst Canary REST API to programmatically create tokens (web bugs, DNS tokens, MS Word documents, AWS API keys), deploy them to strategic locations, monitor for triggered alerts, and generate deception coverage reports.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing deception based detection with canarytoken capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Thinkst Canary Console or canarytokens.org account
- API auth token from Canary Console
- Python 3.9+ with `requests`
- File system access for deploying document and file tokens

## Steps

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. Authenticate to the Canary Console API using auth_token
2. Create web bug (HTTP) tokens for embedding in documents and web pages
3. Create DNS tokens for monitoring DNS resolution attempts
4. Create MS Word document tokens for file share deployment
5. List all active tokens and their trigger history
6. Query recent alerts for triggered token events
7. Generate deception coverage report with deployment recommendations

## Expected Output

- JSON report listing all deployed Canary Tokens, trigger history, alert details, and coverage analysis
- Deployment map showing token types across network segments
## When NOT to Use

- You need to test the implementation (use performing-* skills)
- Task is about configuring existing tools (use configuring-* skills)
- You need to analyze security events (use analyzing-* skills)
- Task is about building detection rules (use building-* skills)
- You don't have access to the target environment
- Task requires vendor-specific expertise (consult vendor docs)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Testing without rate limiting, potentially causing service degradation
- Storing sensitive test data (credentials, tokens) in plain text logs
- Using automated scanners blindly without reviewing results for false positives
## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- Vulnerabilities reproduced with proof-of-concept and impact analysis
- False positives filtered out through manual verification
- Fix recommendations include code-level remediation guidance

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
