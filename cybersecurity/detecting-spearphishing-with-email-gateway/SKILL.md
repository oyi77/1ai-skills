# Detecting Spearphishing with Email Gateway

## Overview
Spearphishing targets specific individuals using personalized, researched content that bypasses generic spam filters. Email security gateways (SEGs) like Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Proofpoint, Mimecast, and Barracuda provide advanced detection capabilities including behavioral analysis, URL detonation, attachment sandboxing, and impersonation detection. This skill covers configuring these gateways to detect and block targeted phishing attacks.


## When to Use
**Trigger phrases:**
- "detecting spearphishing with email gateway"
- "Spearphishing targets specific individuals using personalized, researched conten"


- When investigating security incidents that require detecting spearphishing with email gateway
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites
- Access to email security gateway admin console
- Understanding of email flow architecture (MX records, transport rules)
- Familiarity with SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication
- Knowledge of common spearphishing techniques and pretexts

## Key Concepts

This section covers key concepts for detecting spearphishing with email gateway.

- Ensure all prerequisites are met before proceeding
- Follow the documented workflow steps in sequence
- Record results and any anomalies encountered during this phase
### Spearphishing Characteristics
- **Targeted recipients**: Specific individuals, often executives or finance staff
- **Researched pretexts**: References to real projects, colleagues, or events
- **Impersonation**: Spoofs trusted senders (CEO, vendor, partner)
- **Low volume**: Few emails to avoid pattern-based detection
- **Urgent tone**: Creates pressure to act quickly

### Gateway Detection Layers
1. **Reputation filtering**: IP/domain/URL reputation scoring
2. **Authentication checks**: SPF, DKIM, DMARC validation
3. **Content analysis**: NLP-based analysis of email body
4. **Impersonation detection**: Display name and domain similarity matching
5. **URL analysis**: Real-time URL detonation and redirect following
6. **Attachment sandboxing**: Behavioral analysis of attachments in isolated environments
7. **Behavioral analytics**: Anomaly detection in communication patterns

## Workflow

1. **Scope the task** — define objectives, boundaries, and success criteria
2. **Gather information** — collect all necessary data and context before proceeding
3. **Execute the core workflow** — follow the domain-specific steps methodically
4. **Validate results** — verify outputs against expected outcomes or baselines
5. **Document findings** — record results, anomalies, and recommendations
### Step 1: Configure Impersonation Protection
```
Microsoft Defender for Office 365:
  Security > Anti-phishing policies > Impersonation settings
  - Enable user impersonation protection for VIPs
  - Enable domain impersonation protection
  - Add protected users (CEO, CFO, HR Director)
  - Set action: Quarantine message

Proofpoint:
  Email Protection > Impostor Classifier
  - Enable display name spoofing detection
  - Configure lookalike domain detection
  - Set Impostor threshold sensitivity
```

### Step 2: Configure URL Protection
- Enable Safe Links / URL rewriting
- Enable time-of-click URL detonation
- Block newly registered domains (< 30 days)
- Enable URL redirect chain following

### Step 3: Configure Attachment Sandboxing
- Enable Safe Attachments / attachment sandboxing
- Configure dynamic delivery (deliver body, hold attachments)
- Set sandbox detonation timeout to 60+ seconds
- Block macro-enabled Office documents from external senders

### Step 4: Create Custom Detection Rules
Use the `scripts/process.py` to analyze email gateway logs, identify spearphishing patterns, and generate custom detection rules.

### Step 5: Configure Alert and Response Actions
- Real-time alerts for impersonation attempts
- Automatic quarantine for high-confidence detections
- User notification with safety tips
- Integration with SIEM for correlation

## When NOT to Use

- You need to perform the attack to test detection (use performing-* skills)
- Task is about analyzing past incidents (use analyzing-* skills)
- You need to implement detection rules (use implementing-* skills)
- Task is about threat hunting proactively (use hunting-* skills)
- You don't have access to logs or monitoring data
- Task requires incident response (use IR skills)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Sharing sensitive findings or credentials in unencrypted communications
- Failing to properly scope and contain the assessment before starting

## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- Results validated against known-good baselines or reference implementations
- Documentation complete enough for another analyst to reproduce findings

- **Mimecast Email Security**: https://www.mimecast.com/products/email-security/
- **Barracuda Email Protection**: https://www.barracuda.com/products/email-protection

## Validation
- Impersonation protection correctly identifies spoofed VIP display names
- URL detonation catches malicious links in test phishing emails
- Attachment sandboxing detects weaponized documents
- Custom rules trigger on known spearphishing patterns
- SIEM integration receives gateway alerts

## Process

1. Analyze the task requirements
2. Apply domain expertise
3. Verify output quality

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
