# Performing Purple Team Atomic Testing

## Overview

Cybersecurity skill for performing purple team atomic testing. Follows industry best practices and security standards.

## When to Use

- Validating detection coverage against specific MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Running purple team exercises using Atomic Red Team test library
- Performing ATT&CK coverage gap analysis to identify blind spots in SIEM/EDR
- Building a detection validation loop: execute atomic test, check SIEM, tune rule, retest
- Generating ATT&CK Navigator heatmap layers for executive reporting
- Automating continuous atomic testing in CI/CD or scheduled pipelines
- Mapping threat intelligence reports to executable atomic tests

**Do not use** for full-scope red team engagements requiring custom implants or live adversary simulation beyond atomic tests; use Caldera, SCYTHE, or Cobalt Strike for advanced adversary emulation.

**DISCLAIMER**: Atomic Red Team tests execute real attack techniques. Run only on systems you own or have explicit written authorization to test. Many tests modify system state, create artifacts, or trigger security alerts. Always execute cleanup commands after testing. Never run atomic tests in production without risk acceptance from stakeholders.


## When NOT to Use

- When you lack proper authorization for testing
- For production systems without change management
- When the task requires legal or compliance expertise beyond technical scope


## Prerequisites

- Windows host with PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core 7+ (Linux/macOS supported for cross-platform atomics)
- Invoke-AtomicRedTeam PowerShell module installed from PSGallery
- Atomic Red Team atomics repository cloned locally
- SIEM/EDR with log ingestion from test endpoints (Splunk, Elastic, Microsoft Sentinel, CrowdStrike)
- MITRE ATT&CK Navigator (web-based or local instance) for layer visualization
- Python 3.9+ with `mitreattack-python`, `pyyaml`, and `requests` for automation scripts
- Sigma rules repository for detection correlation
- Administrative/root access on test endpoints
- Isolated test environment (lab, sandbox, or dedicated test range)

## Workflow

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. **Plan Operations** — Define objectives, scope, and success criteria for purple team atomic testing operations.
2. **Prepare Environment** — Set up tools, access, and data sources required for purple team atomic testing.
3. **Execute Core Workflow** — Perform the purple team atomic testing operations following established procedures.
4. **Validate Results** — Verify that results meet quality standards and objectives.
5. **Report Findings** — Document results, observations, and recommendations.
6. **Follow Up** — Track remediation actions and verify fixes where applicable.

## Tools

- **Analysis Platform** — Data processing and visualization
- **Collaboration Tools** — Team coordination and knowledge sharing

## Verification

- [ ] All purple team atomic testing procedures executed completely and documented
- [ ] Findings validated against multiple data sources
- [ ] False positives identified and filtered
- [ ] Results documented with evidence and timestamps
- [ ] Recommendations provided with risk-based prioritization

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
