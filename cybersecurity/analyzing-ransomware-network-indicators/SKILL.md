# Analyzing Ransomware Network Indicators

## Overview

Before and during ransomware execution, adversaries establish C2 channels, exfiltrate data, and download encryption keys. This skill analyzes Zeek conn.log and NetFlow data to detect beaconing patterns (regular-interval callbacks), connections to known TOR exit nodes, large outbound data transfers, and suspicious DNS activity associated with ransomware families.


## When to Use
**Trigger phrases:**
- "analyzing ransomware network indicators"
- "Identify ransomware network indicators including C2 beaconing patterns, TOR exit"


- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing ransomware network indicators
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Zeek conn.log files or NetFlow CSV/JSON exports
- Python 3.8+ with standard library
- TOR exit node list (fetched from Tor Project or threat intel feeds)
- Optional: Known ransomware C2 IOC list

## Steps

```python
# Example: IOC detection
import re

IOC_PATTERNS = {
    "ip": r"\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b",
    "domain": r"\b[a-z0-9-]+\.[a-z]{2,}\b",
    "hash_md5": r"\b[a-f0-9]{32}\b",
    "hash_sha256": r"\b[a-f0-9]{64}\b",
}

def extract_iocs(text: str) -> dict:
    return {k: re.findall(v, text) for k, v in IOC_PATTERNS.items()}
```

1. **Parse Connection Logs** — Ingest Zeek conn.log (TSV) or NetFlow records into structured format
2. **Detect Beaconing Patterns** — Calculate connection interval statistics (mean, stddev, coefficient of variation) to identify periodic callbacks
3. **Check TOR Exit Node Connections** — Cross-reference destination IPs against current TOR exit node list
4. **Identify Data Exfiltration** — Flag connections with unusually high outbound byte ratios to external IPs
5. **Analyze DNS Patterns** — Detect DGA-like domain queries and high-entropy subdomains
6. **Score and Correlate** — Apply composite risk scoring across all indicator types
7. **Generate Report** — Produce structured report with timeline and MITRE ATT&CK mapping

## Expected Output

- JSON report with beaconing detections and interval statistics
- TOR exit node connection alerts
- Data exfiltration flow analysis
- Composite ransomware risk score with MITRE mapping (T1071, T1573, T1041)
## When NOT to Use

- You need to perform the attack, not analyze it (use performing-* skills)
- Task is about detection, not analysis (use detecting-* skills)
- You need to implement controls (use implementing-* skills)
- Task is about threat hunting, not post-incident analysis (use hunting-* skills)
- You don't have access to the artifacts/logs to analyze
- Task requires real-time monitoring (use SOC tools)


## Red Flags

- Performing actions without explicit written authorization from the asset owner
- Testing against production systems without a defined scope and rules of engagement
- Capturing traffic on networks without authorization or privacy considerations
- Leaving packet captures containing sensitive data unencrypted on disk
- Deploying inline blocking rules without testing for false positives first

## Process

1. **Scope** — Define research questions, identify data sources, set time boundaries
1. **Gather** — Collect data from primary sources, APIs, and public records
1. **Synthesize** — Analyze findings, identify patterns, produce actionable report

## Verification

- All steps executed successfully against a test environment before production use
- Output documented with screenshots or logs demonstrating expected behavior
- Captures verified as complete with no dropped packets
- Detection rules tested against known-benign traffic for false positive rate
- Alert thresholds validated and tuned to reduce noise

## Anti-Rationalization

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "We are too small to be targeted" | Automated attacks target everyone. Size does not matter. |
| "Security slows us down" | A breach slows you down 100x more. Build security in from the start. |
| "We will fix it after launch" | Vulnerabilities in production are exploited within hours. Fix before deploy. |
