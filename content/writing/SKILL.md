# Content Writing Factory — Ad Copy, Emails, Long-Form, Product Descriptions



## When Not to Use

- **Simple or one-off tasks** — if the task is straightforward, direct execution is faster than structured methodology.
- **Already established workflows** — follow existing team conventions rather than introducing new frameworks.
- **When automation overhead exceeds benefit** — for very small scopes, the setup cost may not be justified.


## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 18+
- Access to relevant APIs/services for your specific use case
- Basic understanding of the domain concepts


## Commands

```bash
# Refer to the skill's usage section for specific commands
# Adapt these to your workflow
```
## Money-Making Overview

| Service | Client Price | Your Time | ROI |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Ad copy (5 variations) | $500–$2,000 | 1–2 hrs | $400–$1,000/hr |
| Email sequence (5 emails) | $750–$3,000 | 2–4 hrs | $300–$750/hr |
| Long-form article (2,000 words) | $400–$1,500 | 1–2 hrs | $300–$750/hr |
| Product description (10 items) | $300–$1,000 | 1 hr | $300–$1,000/hr |
| Full content bundle (all 4 types) | $2,000–$7,000 | 5–10 hrs | $400–$700/hr |

**Target clients:** E-commerce brands, SaaS startups, newsletters, agencies, course creators who need copy that converts but can't afford a full-time copywriter.

**Delivery model:** Per-project pricing or monthly retainer ($2,000–$5,000/mo for 4 articles + 2 email sequences + ad copy).

## Combined Capabilities

| Capability | Best For | Output Format | Avg Conversion Lift |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Ad Copy** | Meta, Google, TikTok, LinkedIn ads | Headline + body + CTA (5 variants) | 15–40% CTR improvement |
| **Email Writing** | Newsletters, sequences, sales | Plain-text or HTML emails | 20–50% open rate, 3–10% click rate |
| **Long-Form Content** | SEO blogs, thought leadership, guides | 1,500–3,000 word articles | 5–20x organic traffic |
| **Product Descriptions** | E-commerce, SaaS features, landing pages | Feature-benefit bullets + SEO copy | 10–30% conversion uplift |

## Concrete Action Flow

### Phase 1: Brief & Research (30 min)

```python
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict

@dataclass
class ContentBrief:
    project_type: str  # "ad_copy" | "email" | "long_form" | "product_desc"
    client: str

    tone: str  # professional, casual, urgent, luxury
    key_benefits: list[str]
    call_to_action: str
    seo_keywords: list[str] = None
    competitor_examples: list[str] = None
    platform: str = "web"

    def to_prompt(self) -> str:
        return f"""

# Save brief for repeatable workflow

### Phase 2: Ad Copy Generation (1 hr)

```python

### Phase 6: Format & Deliver

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# generate-content-bundle.sh
# Bundle all content into a client-ready deliverable.
# Usage: ./generate-content-bundle.sh client-name output-dir

    print(f"Content bundle written to {output_dir}/")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    produce_content_bundle(sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2])
```

## First Action in 60 Minutes

1. **Create a brief** — `brief = ContentBrief("ad_copy", "ClientX", "ProductY", "SaaS founders", "professional", ["save time", "reduce costs"], "Get Started")`
2. **Generate ad variants** — `ads = generate_ad_variants("ProductY", "SaaS founders", ["save time", "reduce costs"], "Get Started")` 
3. **Generate email sequence** — `emails = generate_email_sequence(...)` and save as JSON
4. **Draft article outline** — `outline = generate_article_outline("remote work productivity", "managers", ["remote work", "productivity tips"])` 
5. **Write product description** — `desc = generate_product_description("Widget Pro", ["API access", "team dashboards"], ["save 10 hrs/week", "reduce errors"], "engineers")`
6. **Ship it** — Zip everything into a client folder. That's your $500–$2,000 deliverable.

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "AI writes it all, no skill needed" | AI generates drafts; humans who know frameworks, hooks, and sequences command $200/hr+. The skill is the system. |
| "Ad copy is just words" | The right hook doubles CTR. Every variant you test is data your client pays for. |
| "Email sequences are dead" | Email ROI is 4,200%. Clients pay premium for sequences that actually convert. |
| "Product descriptions are filler" | Good product copy is the difference between browse and buy. E-commerce clients know this. |
| "Long-form is dying" | Long-form SEO content drives 10x more traffic than short posts. It's the highest-margin content type for agencies. |

## Client Deliverable Checklist

- [ ] Product descriptions: short, medium, long variants
- [ ] Deliverables in client-ready format (no placeholder text)

- [ ] CTA is specific, trackable, and consistent across all pieces

## Output Format

Standard client delivery folder:

```text
