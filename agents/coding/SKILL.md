# Coding Agents

## Money-Making Overview

| Agent | Revenue Impact | Avg. Savings | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Linter Agent** | Enforces standards at scale | $300–1,000/project | Bulk rule application, migration, cleanup |
| **Perf Agent** | Cuts infra costs 20–40% | $2,000–20,000/year | Bottleneck profiling, query tuning, cost reduction |
| **Refactor Agent** | Reduces maintenance debt 50% | $3,000–15,000/refactor | Complexity reduction, modernization, splitting monoliths |
| **Security Agent** | Prevents P1 production incidents | $5,000–50,000/incident | Bug bounty, vulnerability scanning, pentest automation |
| **Test Agent** | Cuts regression bugs 80% | $2,000–8,000/release | Coverage gaps, regression tests, e2e flows |

**Combined ROI:** A single pass through all five agents on a medium codebase (50K LOC) saves **$15,000–50,000** by preventing production bugs, reducing cloud costs, and slashing maintenance overhead.

## When to Use

**Linter first** — before every PR, after merge conflicts, when adopting new rules, migrating linters.

**Perf when it hurts** — app is slow, memory is growing, queries lag, infra costs too high, capacity planning.

**Refactor before features** — make the change easy before making the easy change. High cyclomatic complexity, duplicated code, monolithic files.

**Security before deploy** — every commit touching auth, payments, PII, or external APIs requires a security gate.

**Test always** — new features (TDD), regression tests for bugs, coverage gaps, integration tests, e2e.

### When NOT to Use

- Trivial one-liner changes — just make the edit.
- Real-time human judgment — agents cannot decide product or business trade-offs.
- Agent lacks access to required tools, credentials, or data.

### Gate Matrix

| Gate | When | Tool | Fail Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lint** | Pre-commit, pre-PR | eslint, ruff, revive, prettier | Any error-level rule violation |
| **Perf** | Pre-release, monthly | py-spy, valgrind, k6, lighthouse | P95 > threshold, memory leak detected |
| **Refactor** | Before feature work | cyclomatic-complexity, sloc | Complexity > 15 per function |
| **Security** | Pre-deploy, bug bounty | semgrep, trufflehog, zap | Any P1/P2 vulnerability |
| **Test** | Post-commit, pre-merge | pytest, vitest, go test | Coverage < 80%, any test failure |

## Concrete Action Flow

### Full Quality Pipeline

```bash
# 1. LINT: Clean up before PR
agent linter-agent \
    --path "src/" \
    --config ".eslintrc.cjs" \
    --fix \
    --require "no-unused-vars, no-console"

# 2. PERF: Profile the hot path
agent perf-agent \
    --profile "GET /api/users/:id" \
    --benchmark "1000 req/s" \
    --target "p95 < 200ms" \
    --output perf-report.md

# 3. REFACTOR: Clean up before feature work
agent refactor-agent \
    --target "src/legacy/users.ts" \
    --complexity-threshold 15 \
    --remove-dead-code \
    --modernize "callbacks->async"

# 4. SECURITY: Audit before deploy
agent security-agent \
    --target "https://staging.example.com" \
    --scan "xss, sqli, ssti, ssrf" \
    --output security-report.json

# 5. TEST: Fill coverage gaps
agent test-agent \
    --path "src/services/" \
    --target-coverage 85 \
    --type "unit, integration" \
    --output coverage-report.json
```

### Quick Bug Fix Cycle

```bash
# 1. LINT the fix area first
agent linter-agent --path "src/buggy-file.ts" --fix

# 2. REFACTOR if the code is messy
agent refactor-agent --path "src/buggy-file.ts" --complexity-threshold 10

# 3. Add regression TEST
agent test-agent \
    --bug "SESSION-123" \
    --regression \
    --path "src/buggy-file.ts"

# 4. SECURITY check the change
agent security-agent --diff "$(git diff)"
```

## First Action in 60 Minutes

1. **Run linter-agent** on your entire `src/` directory with `--fix`. This removes noise immediately.
2. **Run security-agent** on your staging environment or a recent diff. One quick scan surfaces the top risks.
3. **Run test-agent** with `--coverage-report` to see where you are most exposed.
4. **Run perf-agent** on your slowest endpoint (check your APM or logs for P99).
5. **Run refactor-agent** on the file with the highest churn (git blame reveals it).

**Total time:** ~50 min. You will walk away with: clean code, known vulnerabilities patched, coverage gaps mapped, one bottleneck fixed, and one messy file cleaned.

## Real Code Examples

### Python: Full Quality Gate CI Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""CI quality gate: lint → perf → refactor → security → test."""

import json, subprocess, sys
from pathlib import Path

def gate(name: str, *args) -> dict:
    """Run a coding agent gate."""
    cmd = ["agent", f"{name}-agent", "--json", *args]
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
    return json.loads(result.stdout)

def quality_pipeline(changed_files: list[str]):
    results = {}

    # Gate 1: Lint
    results["lint"] = gate("linter",
        *[f"--path={f}" for f in changed_files],
        "--fix", "--strict")
    if results["lint"].get("errors", 0) > 0:
        print("LINT FAILED — fixing...")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Gate 2: Security (lightning scan)
    results["security"] = gate("security",
        "--scan=secrets,injection",
        "--diff", subprocess.run(
            ["git", "diff", "HEAD"],
            capture_output=True, text=True).stdout)
    if any(f["severity"] in ("P1", "P2")
           for f in results["security"].get("findings", [])):
        print("SECURITY FAILED — aborting")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Gate 3: Refactor (complexity check)
    results["refactor"] = gate("refactor",
        *[f"--path={f}" for f in changed_files],
        "--complexity-threshold=12",
        "--dry-run")
    if results["refactor"].get("high_complexity", 0) > 0:
        print(f"REFACTOR: {results['refactor']['high_complexity']} complex functions")

    # Gate 4: Coverage check
    results["test"] = gate("test",
        "--coverage-only",
        "--min-coverage=80")
    if results["test"].get("coverage", 0) < 80:
        print(f"COVERAGE: {results['test']['coverage']}% — below 80%")
        sys.exit(1)

    print("All quality gates passed")
    return results

if __name__ == "__main__":
    files = sys.argv[1:] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else ["src/"]
    quality_pipeline(files)
```

### Bash: One-Shot Quality Report

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# quality-report.sh — run all 5 agents and produce a summary

DIR="${1:-src}"
REPORT="quality-report-$(date +%Y%m%d).md"

echo "# Quality Report $(date)" > "$REPORT"
echo "" >> "$REPORT"

echo "## Lint" >> "$REPORT"
agent linter-agent --path "$DIR" --report --output /tmp/lint.json
jq -r '.summary' /tmp/lint.json >> "$REPORT"

echo "## Performance" >> "$REPORT"
agent perf-agent --path "$DIR" --quick-check --output /tmp/perf.json
jq -r '.hotspots[] | "- \(.file):\(.line) — \(.message)"' /tmp/perf.json >> "$REPORT"

echo "## Refactor Candidates" >> "$REPORT"
agent refactor-agent --path "$DIR" --list-candidates --output /tmp/refactor.json
jq -r '.candidates[] | "- \(.file) — complexity \(.complexity)"' /tmp/refactor.json >> "$REPORT"

echo "## Security" >> "$REPORT"
agent security-agent --path "$DIR" --quick-scan --output /tmp/security.json
jq -r '.findings[] | "- \(.severity): \(.message)"' /tmp/security.json >> "$REPORT"

echo "## Test Coverage" >> "$REPORT"
agent test-agent --coverage-only --output /tmp/test.json
jq -r '. | "- Coverage: \(.coverage)%"' /tmp/test.json >> "$REPORT"

echo "Report written to $REPORT"
```

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "My code doesn't have lint errors" | Linter catches the 15 things your editor highlights that you ignore |
| "I will profile when it's slow" | By then the bottleneck is in production costing money |
| "Refactoring is a waste of time" | High complexity = high bug rate. Refactoring pays for itself |
| "I am careful enough, no security issues" | Every developer has blind spots — adversarial review catches them |
| "Tests take too long to write" | Test agent writes tests 10x faster than manual TDD |
| "The existing test coverage is fine" | If you don't measure it, you don't know. Measure then act |
| "I run all these tools locally" | Agents combine + orchestrate + explain results. Tools alone don't |
