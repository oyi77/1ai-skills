# Book-to-Skill Converter

Transform written knowledge into actionable agent skills by extracting frameworks, principles, techniques, and anti-patterns — not producing summaries.

**Upstream author:** [@virgiliojr94](https://github.com/virgiliojr94)  
**This integration:** Full extraction pipeline vendored into `core/book-to-skill/`  
**License:** MIT  
**Format support:** PDF, EPUB, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, reStructuredText, AsciiDoc, HTML, RTF, MOBI/AZW/AZW3

## When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "turn this book into a skill"
- "book-to-skill"
- "convert this PDF to an agent skill"
- "generate a skill from this document"
- "study this book with my agent"

**Use when:**
- You want your agent to reference a technical book while coding
- You have a collection of docs/papers you constantly re-read
- You need structured access to a book's content without dumping the whole PDF into context
- You own a book PDF and want it as an on-demand agent skill

**Don't use for:**
- Fiction / narrative books (the tool works technically but the output isn't useful)
- Books you don't own (copyright compliance — you must own the source)
- Simple web articles (use web extraction instead; full pipeline is overkill)

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Excuse | Reality | Rule |
|--------|---------|------|
| "I'll just read the book" | Reading ≠ actionable skill; skills need frameworks, not summaries | Extract mental models, decision rules, and code patterns |
| "One skill per book" | Books contain multiple transferable frameworks | Split into atomic skills by framework/model |
| "PDF extraction is enough" | PDFs lose structure; need chapter, section, diagram mapping | Parse structure first, then content |

## How It Works

```
PDF / EPUB / DOCX / HTML / Markdown / RTF / MOBI
    │
    ▼
Extract text → Detect structure (chapters, headings)
    │
    ▼
LLM analyzes: frameworks, principles, techniques, anti-patterns
    │
    ▼
Generate structured skill:
  ├── SKILL.md          (core mental models + chapter index, ~4K tokens)
  ├── chapters/ch*.md   (one per chapter, ~1K tokens each, loaded on-demand)
  ├── glossary.md       (key terms with chapter refs, ~1.5K tokens)
  ├── patterns.md       (techniques, algorithms, design patterns, ~2K tokens)
  └── cheatsheet.md     (decision tables, quick-reference rules, ~1K tokens)
```

Chapter files are **loaded on-demand** — they don't count against the skill budget until queried.

## Pipeline Location

The full extraction pipeline lives at `core/book-to-skill/` in this repo:

```

## Installation

```bash
# From repo root
cd core/book-to-skill

# Check what extractors are available
python3 -m book_to_skill --check

# Install deps based on your formats
pip3 install pypdf beautifulsoup4 python-docx ebooklib striprtf
sudo apt install poppler-utils   # for pdftotext (text-heavy PDFs, instant)

# For technical books with tables/code blocks
pip3 install docling              # ~1.5s/page, preserves markdown tables
```

---

## Usage

### Run the pipeline

```bash
cd core/book-to-skill

# Check setup
python3 -m book_to_skill --check

# Single file → skill
python3 -m book_to_skill /path/to/book.pdf my-book-slug

# Multiple files → one unified skill
python3 -m book_to_skill paper1.pdf notes.txt research-dir/ unified-research

# Analyze only (no skill generation)
python3 -m book_to_skill --analyze /path/to/book.pdf

# Update existing skill with new content
python3 -m book_to_skill new-chapter.pdf ~/.claude/skills/<existing-skill>/
```

### After generation

The skill lands in your agent's skills directory:
- `~/.claude/skills/<slug>/` for Claude Code
- `~/.copilot/skills/<slug>/` for Copilot CLI
- `~/.agents/skills/<slug>/` for cross-agent

Query it like any skill:

```
/my-book-slug                          # load core mental models
/my-book-slug replication              # find + explain a topic
/my-book-slug ch05                     # dive into chapter 5
/my-book-slug "what chapters exist?"   # browse structure
```

### Processing within an agent session

1. Verify the file exists and is a supported format
2. Ask if it's **technical** (tables, code) or **text-heavy** (prose) — this picks the extractor
3. Run `cd core/book-to-skill && python3 -m book_to_skill <path> <slug>`
4. Confirm the generated skill is loadable
5. Load it with the skill's slug

## Modes of Operation

| Mode | Flag | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Full conversion** | *(default)* | One or more paths → complete skill |
| **Analyze only** | `--analyze` | Extract and report structure without generating skill |
| **From prior analysis** | `--from-analysis <file>` | Skip extraction, use existing notes |
| **Update / fold-in** | *(target existing dir)* | Point at existing skill folder to merge new content |

---

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies by format

| Format | Recommended tool | Install | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|---------|-------|
| PDF (text-heavy) | `pdftotext` | `sudo apt install poppler-utils` | Instant, good for prose |
| PDF (technical) | `docling` | `pip3 install docling` | Preserves tables + code blocks |
| PDF fallback | `pypdf` / `pdfminer.six` | `pip3 install pypdf` | Built-in fallback chain |
| EPUB | `ebooklib` + `beautifulsoup4` | `pip3 install ebooklib beautifulsoup4` | Best quality |
| DOCX | `python-docx` | `pip3 install python-docx` | |
| HTML | `beautifulsoup4` | `pip3 install beautifulsoup4` | |
| RTF | `striprtf` | `pip3 install striprtf` | |
| MOBI/AZW | Calibre `ebook-convert` | calibre-ebook.com | External app |
| TXT/MD/RST/AsciiDoc | Built-in | None | No deps needed |

### Performance

- 244-page tech book: ~165s (Docling) or 0.1s (pdftotext)
- Typical one-pass LLM cost: ~$0.90–$1.40 on Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Generated skill: ~4K tokens core + ~1K tokens per chapter
- **24×–51× fewer tokens** vs dumping the full book into context per question

### Privacy

All extraction runs locally. Your files are never uploaded by the pipeline. Only the LLM structuring call goes to your provider.

## Copyright & Fair Use

book-to-ship ships **no book content**. It's a converter you point at files you already own.

- Processing is local
- Generated skill is a structured derivative (framework names, definitions) — not a reproduction
- Do NOT redistribute generated skills of copyrighted works
- Keep skills of third-party books private
