# Find Skills - Intelligent Skill Discovery System

## Overview

Automatically discover and integrate community skills from skills.sh and awesome-openclaw-skills when your local skills don't cover a need. Includes credibility scoring, safety checks, and seamless activation.

**Makes your OpenClaw complete and self-sufficient** - never say "I can't do that" again!

## When to Use

**Automatic Activation** when:
- User asks "how do I do X" where X isn't covered by local skills
- User says "find a skill for X" or "is there a skill for X"
- User asks "can you do X" where X is specialized
- User wants to extend agent capabilities
- User mentions wishing for help with a specific domain

**Examples**:
- "How do I optimize my React app?" → Search for React performance skills
- "Can you help with Docker?" → Search for Docker skills
- "I need to create a changelog" → Search for changelog skills

## Skill Discovery Process

### Step 1: Check Local Skills First

```javascript
function checkLocalSkills(userRequest) {
  // Check .skill-activation.json
  const localSkills = loadActivationRules();
  
  // Search by keywords
  const matches = findMatchingSkills(userRequest, localSkills);
  
  if (matches.length > 0) {
    return { found: true, skills: matches, source: 'local' };
  }
  
  return { found: false };
}
```

### Step 2: Search Community Skills

```bash
# Search skills.sh
npx skills find [query]

# Example searches
npx skills find react performance
npx skills find docker deployment
npx skills find api testing
```

**Search Strategy**:
1. Extract key terms from user request
2. Search skills.sh first (curated, high quality)
3. Fall back to awesome-openclaw-skills (comprehensive)
4. Return top 5 results ranked by credibility

### Step 3: Evaluate Credibility

**Credibility Score** (0-100):

```javascript
function calculateCredibilityScore(skill) {
  let score = 0;
  
  // 1. Usage Stats (40 points)
  const usageCount = skill.usageCount || 0;
  if (usageCount > 100000) score += 40;
  else if (usageCount > 50000) score += 35;
  else if (usageCount > 10000) score += 30;
  else if (usageCount > 5000) score += 25;
  else if (usageCount > 1000) score += 20;
  else score += Math.min(usageCount / 50, 15);
  
  // 2. Author Reputation (30 points)
  const trustedAuthors = [
    'vercel-labs',
    'anthropics',
    'obra',
    'supabase',
    'remotion-dev',
    'expo',
    'better-auth'
  ];
  
  if (trustedAuthors.includes(skill.author)) {
    score += 30;
  } else if (skill.authorStars > 1000) {
    score += 25;
  } else if (skill.authorStars > 500) {
    score += 20;
  } else {
    score += Math.min(skill.authorStars / 25, 15);
  }
  
  // 3. Update Frequency (15 points)
  const daysSinceUpdate = getDaysSince(skill.lastUpdated);
  if (daysSinceUpdate < 30) score += 15;
  else if (daysSinceUpdate < 90) score += 12;
  else if (daysSinceUpdate < 180) score += 8;
  else if (daysSinceUpdate < 365) score += 5;
  else score += 2;
  
  // 4. Documentation Quality (15 points)
  if (skill.hasExamples) score += 5;
  if (skill.hasCodeSamples) score += 5;
  if (skill.descriptionLength > 500) score += 5;
  
  return Math.min(score, 100);
}
```

**Safety Thresholds**:
- **90-100**: Auto-install (trusted sources)
- **70-89**: Recommend with high confidence
- **50-69**: Recommend with caution
- **Below 50**: Show but warn user

### Step 4: Present to User

## Automation Examples

### Example 1: User Asks for React Help

```
USER: "How do I make my React app faster?"

AGENT:
1. Check local skills → No React performance skill found
2. Search community → npx skills find react performance
3. Evaluate results:
   - vercel-react-best-practices (Score: 95)
   - react-performance-patterns (Score: 82)
4. Present top result to user
5. Offer to install

RESPONSE:
"I found a highly-rated skill for React performance optimization!

**vercel-react-best-practices** (Credibility: 95/100)
- Official Vercel engineering guidelines
- 137.4K uses, updated 2 days ago

Would you like me to install it? This will give me comprehensive React and Next.js optimization knowledge."
```

### Example 2: User Needs Docker Help

```
USER: "Can you help me with Docker?"

AGENT:
1. Check local skills → No Docker skill found
2. Search → npx skills find docker
3. Find: docker-expert (Score: 92)
4. Auto-install (score > 90)
5. Update activation rules
6. Confirm to user

RESPONSE:
"✅ I've installed the 'docker-expert' skill (Credibility: 92/100)!

I can now help you with:
- Docker containerization
- Dockerfile optimization
- Docker Compose
- Container debugging
- Best practices

What Docker task would you like help with?"
```

### Example 3: Low Credibility Skill

```
USER: "Find a skill for blockchain development"

AGENT:
1. Search → npx skills find blockchain
2. Find: crypto-dev-helper (Score: 48)
3. Below threshold (< 70)
4. Warn user

RESPONSE:
"⚠️ I found a skill for blockchain development, but it has low credibility:

**crypto-dev-helper** (Credibility: 48/100)
- Only 320 uses
- Last updated 8 months ago
- Unknown author

I recommend:
1. Searching for more established blockchain skills
2. Using general development skills instead
3. Proceeding with caution if you choose to install

Would you like me to search for alternatives?"
```

## Safety Features

### 1. Sandboxed Evaluation
```javascript
// Before installing, check skill metadata
function evaluateSkillSafety(skill) {
  const risks = [];
  
  // Check for suspicious patterns
  if (skill.requiresSystemAccess) {
    risks.push('Requires system-level access');
  }
  
  if (skill.hasExternalDependencies) {
    risks.push('Has external dependencies');
  }
  
  if (skill.modifiesGlobalState) {
    risks.push('Modifies global configuration');
  }
  
  return {
    safe: risks.length === 0,
    risks: risks
  };
}
```

### 2. User Confirmation
```
For scores 70-89:
"This skill looks good but I recommend reviewing it first.
[View on skills.sh] [Install Anyway] [Skip]"

For scores < 70:
"⚠️ This skill has low credibility. I don't recommend installing it.
[View Details] [Install at Your Own Risk] [Cancel]"
```

### 3. Rollback Capability
```bash
# If skill causes issues
npx skills remove vercel-labs/agent-skills@vercel-react-best-practices

# Restore previous activation rules
git checkout .skill-activation.json
```

---

## Workflow Integration

### Daily Routine Assistant

```javascript
// Morning routine
async function morningRoutine() {
  // Check for skill updates
  await run('npx skills check');
  
  // Update high-credibility skills
  const updates = await getAvailableUpdates();
  for (const skill of updates) {
    if (skill.credibilityScore >= 90) {
      await run(`npx skills update ${skill.name}`);
    }
  }
  
  // Report to user
  console.log('✅ Skills updated and ready for the day!');
}
```

### Continuous Learning

```javascript
// Track what skills are used most
function trackSkillUsage() {
  // Log skill activations
  // Identify gaps
  // Suggest new skills proactively
  
  if (userFrequentlyAsksAbout('testing')) {
    suggestSkill('javascript-testing-patterns');
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Check Local First
Don't search community if you already have the capability.

### 2. Prefer High-Credibility Sources
Trust vercel-labs, anthropics, obra over unknown authors.

### 3. Keep Skills Updated
```bash
# Weekly update check
npx skills check
npx skills update
```

### 4. Monitor Skill Performance
- Track which skills are actually helpful
- Remove unused skills
- Report issues to skill authors

### 5. Contribute Back
- If you create useful skills, publish them
- Share improvements with community
- Help others discover your Indonesian-specific skills
