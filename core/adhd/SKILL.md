# ADHD — Parallel Divergent Ideation

**Upstream:** [github.com/UditAkhourii/adhd](https://github.com/UditAkhourii/adhd)  
**License:** MIT  
**Preprint:** [adhdstack.github.io](https://adhdstack.github.io/)

Stop picking the textbook answer. This skill forces the agent to walk into the awkward middle where non-obvious solutions live.

---

## When to Use

**Trigger phrases:**
- "/adhd"
- "ADHD mode"
- "use parallel ideation"
- "brainstorm this"
- "give me a few ways to..."
- "think outside the box on this"

**Use when:**
- Architecture decisions where the obvious answer may not be best
- API/SDK surface design (naming, ergonomics, DX tradeoffs)
- Naming things (products, features, variables, endpoints)
- Fuzzy debugging with no known root cause
- Open-ended strategy or positioning
- Schema / data model design

**Don't use for:**
- Syntax lookups ("what's the Python equivalent of...")
- Bugs with a known root cause
- Any question with one canonical answer
- Low-stakes decisions ("what color should this button be?")
- When the user says "quick", "standard", "canonical", "textbook", or "just"

---

## Pre-flight Gate

This skill is expensive (~5–10× a single answer). Run this gate before proceeding.

**Step 1. Explicit invocation.** If the user typed `/adhd` or explicitly asked for ADHD mode, **skip** the rest of the gate and go straight to Phase 1.

**Step 2. Self-judge.** Ask yourself three questions. If any answer is **no**, abort.

1. **Open-ended?** Would a senior engineer give multiple viable answers, or is there one canonical answer?
2. **High-stakes?** Is the cost of the obvious answer being wrong actually high?
3. **Open phrasing?** Did the user avoid words like "quick", "standard", "canonical", "textbook", "just"?

If all three pass, proceed to Phase 1. Otherwise, answer directly. Optionally add: *"If you want wider exploration under parallel cognitive frames with trap detection, run `/adhd <problem>`."*

---

## The Loop

Two strict phases. **Do not mix them** — the critic strangles the generator.

### Phase 1 — Diverge (no critic)

1. **Pick 5 cognitive frames** from the table below. Bias toward engineering tags for code problems. Always include at least one wild frame.

2. **Spawn 5 parallel isolated branches.** Each gets only:
   - The problem P
   - Any context the user provided
   - The chosen frame's vantage prompt
   - A system instruction that forbids evaluation

   > You are in DIVERGENT mode — a generator, not a critic.
   > Generate 6 short distinct ideas under this frame. Each idea is one
   > phrase or one sentence. Do not evaluate. Do not rank. Do not hedge.
   > The first three obvious answers everyone would give are banned.
   > Push past them into the awkward middle.
   > Output a JSON array only: [{"text": "...", "rationale": "..."}, ...]

3. **Critical invariant:** Branches must be parallel and isolated. Do NOT serialize them. Do NOT pass one branch's output to another. Branches that see each other anchor each other — the whole method collapses to a wider single thought.

### Phase 2 — Focus (critic on)

1. **Score.** Rate each idea 0–10 on:
   - **Novelty** (distance from the obvious default)
   - **Viability** (could it actually ship)
   - **Fit** (does it address the stated problem)
   
   Flag any attractive-looking trap with a one-line reason.

2. **Cluster.** Group into 3–6 clusters by underlying angle, not surface keywords. Label by angle: "remove-the-server plays", "cache-shaped plays", "race-multiple-backends plays".

3. **Deepen the top 3.** Rank by weighted score (Novelty 0.35 + Viability 0.40 + Fit 0.25), exclude traps, take top 3. For each:
   - 4–8 sentence sketch of how it works
   - The load-bearing risk
   - The first concrete step a builder would take
   - 3–5 child ideas (variations, hybrids, unlocks)

   > You are in FOCUS mode. Take one promising idea and connect dots.
   > Sketch how it would actually work in 4–8 sentences. Name the
   > load-bearing risk. Name the first concrete step a coder would take.
   > Then generate 3–5 sub-ideas that branch off. Output JSON only.

## Cognitive Frames

Pick 5 per run. For code problems: 4 tagged `code`/`design` + 1 tagged `wild`.

| Frame | Vantage Prompt | Tags |
|-------|---------------|------|
| **hardware engineer** | You think in latency, memory layout, and physical constraints. Re-ask this as a hardware/firmware problem. What does the bus topology, cache, timing budget tell you? | code, wild |
| **regulator** | You audit systems for compliance and failure modes. What must be provable, traceable, or refusable here? | design, general |
| **10-year-old** | You are a curious 10 year old who has never seen software. Describe naive but unencumbered approaches. Ignore convention. | general, wild |
| **competitor trying to break it** | You are a hostile competitor or attacker. Generate approaches that exploit, fail, or sabotage the obvious solution. Then invert into ideas. | code, design |
| **biology** | Transplant a mechanism from biology (immune systems, neural plasticity, cell signaling, evolution, gut flora). Force-fit it onto this engineering problem. | code, wild |
| **logistics** | Steal mechanisms from logistics: queues, batching, just-in-time, hub-and-spoke, returns, last-mile. Apply them literally. | code, design |
| **game design** | Approach this as a game designer. What are the loops, rewards, friction, save-states, speedrun tricks? Treat the user as a player. | design, general |
| **markets** | Treat the problem as a market. Buyers, sellers, market-makers. What does an auction, a futures contract, a clearing house look like here? | design, wild |
| **inversion** | Ask the OPPOSITE question. If goal is X, brainstorm how to guarantee NOT X. Then negate each answer back. | code, design, general |
| **extreme: $0 budget, 1 hour** | No money, no team, one hour. What is the crudest version that still does the load-bearing thing? | code, general |
| **extreme: infinite budget, 10 years** | Infinite compute, infinite engineers, a decade. What is the maximalist version? | design, wild |
| **remove the load-bearing assumption** | Name the thing everyone treats as fixed (framework, database, request-response model, network). Imagine it is gone. What is possible? | code, design, wild |
| **speedrunner** | You are a speedrunner. Find glitches, skips, out-of-bounds tricks, frame-perfect shortcuts. What is the abusive-but-legal path? | code, wild |
| **ant colony** | No central planner. Many dumb agents, local rules, pheromone trails. How does the problem solve itself emergently? | code, wild |
| **3am on-call** | You are the on-call engineer woken at 3am when this breaks. What design would let you not get paged? | code, design |

Vary picks across sessions so the same problem produces different candidate sets when re-run.

## Output Shape

Render in this order. Structure is the point — do not collapse into prose.

1. **Brief.** One–two lines confirming the problem and any reframe used.
2. **Wide set.** Full pool grouped by cluster. Score chips: `[N7 V8 F9]` per idea.
3. **Converge.** 2–4 idea shortlist. Why each is on the list. Mark non-obvious pick with ★. List traps with one-line reasons.
4. **Focus.** 3 deepened branches: sketch, risk, first step, child ideas.
5. **Provocation.** One wildcard question that opens a new direction if nothing landed.

---

## Cost & Calibration

~10 agent calls per run (5 diverge + 1 score + 1 cluster + 3 deepen). About 5–10× single-shot.

| Context | Frames × Ideas | Total |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Quick naming decision | 3 × 4 | ~12 |
| Default | 5 × 6 | ~30 |
| High-stakes strategy | 5 × 8 | ~40 |

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | What it looks like | Fix |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Convergence disguised as divergence** | Ten variations of one idea | Check: do all share one assumption? |
| **Weird-for-weird's-sake** | 30 unsorted absurdities | Always converge. Structure is half the value. |
| **Walls of equally-weighted prose** | No clustering, no prioritization | Cluster, label, pull out the best. |
| **Refusing to commit** | "Here are 20 ideas, you decide" | Take a position. Generate wide, converge with opinion. |
| **Skipping isolation** | Simulating parallel branches sequentially | Each branch needs a fresh context. Parallel or nothing. |
