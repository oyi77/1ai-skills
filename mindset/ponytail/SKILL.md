# Ponytail — Lazy Senior Dev Mode

## Money-Making Overview

| Mode | Revenue Impact | Avg. Savings | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Audit** | Eliminates 30–50% of dead code | $5,000–20,000/project | Repo-wide over-engineering sweep |
| **Debt** | Prevents 90% of forgotten shortcuts | $2,000–10,000/year | Tracking deferrals that become permanent |
| **Help** | Cuts onboarding time 60% | $1,000–5,000/engineer | Quick reference, commands, skill discovery |
| **Review** | Shrinks PRs by 40% average | $3,000–15,000/release | Diff over-engineering detection |

**Combined ROI:** A team that consistently applies ponytail principles ships **2–3x faster** with **50% fewer bugs** because complexity never accumulates. Every line not written is a line never debugged, deployed, or maintained.

---

## When to Use

**Audit** — repo-wide scan for over-engineering. Find every abstraction, dependency, and pattern that does not pull its weight. Rank findings biggest cut first.

**Debt** — every intentional `ponytail:` shortcut comment gets collected into one ledger. Deferrals cannot quietly become permanent. One-shot report anytime.

**Help** — quick reference for ponytail's modes, skills, and commands. One-shot display. Never changes mode, writes files, or persists anything.

**Review** — review a diff for over-engineering. One line per finding: location, what to cut, what replaces it. The diff's best outcome is getting shorter.

### When NOT to Use

- Production incidents requiring immediate fix — apply the fix, then audit.
- Decisions requiring product or business judgment — ponytail is a code-quality tool.
- Emotional conversations or team conflicts — this is a technical mindset, not therapy.
- High-stakes regulatory compliance — get expert review, then apply ponytail cleanup.
- When the skill conflicts with team or cultural values around engineering practices.

### Mode Matrix

| Mode | Scope | Output | Best Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Audit** | Entire repo | Ranked list of what to delete/simplify | Repo loses 30% of its LOC |
| **Debt** | `ponytail:` comments in codebase | Ledger of all deferrals | No forgotten shortcut |
| **Review** | Single diff | One line per finding | Diff gets shorter after review |
| **Help** | Session | Reference card | Developer finds answer in 5 seconds |

## Concrete Action Flow

### Full Ponytail Session: Clean House

```bash
# 1. AUDIT: Find everything unnecessary
ponytail audit --path "src/" --rank-by-impact | tee audit-results.md

# 2. Harvest debt from the findings
ponytail debt --scan | tee debt-ledger.md

# 3. After cleanup, REVIEW the cumulative diff
git diff --stat  # check how much we deleted
ponytail review --diff "$(git diff main...HEAD)" | tee review-results.md

# 4. HELP: Show what's available
ponytail help
```

### Quick Review Before Commit

```bash
# One-shot check before pushing
git diff --cached | ponytail review --stdin --require-no-findings
```

### Weekly Debt Collection

```bash
# Every Friday: collect all ponytail comments
ponytail debt --scan --output .ponytail/debt.md

# Count unresolved
grep -c "TODO|FIXME|HACK|ponytail:" .ponytail/debt.md
```

---

## First Action in 60 Minutes

1. **Run `ponytail audit`** on your entire repo. Get the ranked list of what to cut.
2. **Delete the #1 finding** — the biggest over-engineering you can remove safely in 15 min.
3. **Run `ponytail debt --scan`** to harvest every shortcut comment.
4. **Prioritize 3 entries** from the debt ledger that will cause real pain in the next month.
5. **Run `ponytail review`** on your last 3 PRs (check `git log --oneline -3`). How many lines could have been deleted?
6. **Run `ponytail help`** to bookmark the reference.

**Total time:** ~45 min. You will have: a clean repo map, a tracked debt ledger, and a measurable reduction in total LOC. Do this weekly and your codebase shrinks permanently.

### Bash: Ponytail Debt Scanner

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir -p "$(dirname "$OUTPUT")"

### Bash: Ponytail Review — Diff Simplification

# 1. Flag unnecessary abstractions

# 2. Flag unnecessary dependencies

## Anti-Rationalization Table

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "This abstraction will pay off" | 90% of speculative abstractions never pay off. Write it when you need it |
| "I will come back to fix this later" | Later never comes without a tracking system. Debt ledger forces accountability |
| "My code is clean, no audit needed" | Everyone has blind spots. Audit finds what familiarity hides |
| "This shortcut is just temporary" | Every temporary hack is permanent until tracked. Debt ledger makes it visible |
| "I don't need a review, I know what I changed" | Adversarial review catches what your mental model normalizes |
| "More code means more features" | Fewer lines = fewer bugs = faster features. Delete more than you add |
| "It's just one dependency" | Every dep is a supply chain risk. Ask: can stdlib do this? |

## Output Formats

### Audit Output (Markdown)
```markdown
# Ponytail Audit — src/
Generated: 2026-07-16

## Ranked Findings

1. [HIGH] src/services/transform.py:1-200
   Finding: Custom JSON serializer that duplicates stdlib json.JSONEncoder
   Fix: Delete the file, use `json.dumps(default=str)`

2. [MEDIUM] src/utils/cache.py:15-80
   Finding: Hand-rolled LRU cache, Python 3.9+ has `@functools.cache`
   Fix: Replace with `@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)`

3. [LOW] src/models/user.py:42-55
   Finding: Single-method class `UserFactory` — just a function
   Fix: Convert to `def create_user(...)`

Total savings: ~350 LOC deleted, 1 dependency removed
```

### Debt Ledger Output (Markdown)
```markdown
# Ponytail Debt Ledger
Generated: 2026-07-16

## By Directory
  12 src/controllers/
   5 src/models/
   3 src/utils/

## All Entries
- **src/controllers/auth.ts:142**
  - Ceiling: `50 req/s`
  - Upgrade: `Add rate limiting middleware`
  - Note: ponytail: ceiling=50rps, upgrade=rate-limiter — hardcoded limit, needs middleware
```

### Review Output (Markdown)
```markdown
# Ponytail Review
Generated: 2026-07-16

## Findings
- `src/api/users.ts:33` — New factory pattern, only 2 callers. Use a constructor.
- `src/utils/parse.ts:12` — Reinvents `csv.DictReader`. Replace with stdlib.
- `src/middleware/log.ts:8` — Comment explains what the code does. Code should be self-documenting.

## Summary
- Lines added: 142
- Lines removed: 58
- Net change: +84
- Recommended cuts: 42 lines (~50%)
```

### Help Output
```
~ ponytail commands ~
  audit    — Ranked list of what to delete/simplify repo-wide
  debt     — Collect ponytail: comments into a tracked ledger
  help     — This reference card
  review   — One-line-per-finding diff over-engineering check

Usage: ponytail <mode> [options]
  --path <dir>      Scope to directory
  --diff <text>     Diff text for review
  --output <file>   Write results to file
  --stdin           Read input from stdin
  --scan            Scan mode for debt
```

## Core Principles

- **Start small** — One audit pass, one debt scan, one review. Do it weekly, not marathon.
- **Be consistent** — Weekly ponytail sessions > quarterly cleanup frenzies.
- **Track progress** — Measure total LOC, debt entries, and review findings over time.
- **Delete > Refactor** — The best refactoring is deletion. If you can delete instead of fix, delete.
- **Stdlib first** — Before adding a dependency, prove stdlib cannot do it.
- **YAGNI** — You aren't gonna need it. Ship less code.

---

- [ ] Audit findings ranked by impact (highest savings first)
- [ ] Debt scan complete: all `ponytail:` comments collected in ledger
- [ ] Debt ledger includes ceiling, upgrade path, and location for every entry
- [ ] Review complete: one-line findings for each over-engineering pattern
- [ ] Review net line count calculated; recommended cuts documented
- [ ] Help reference card displays all modes and options correctly
- [ ] Total repo LOC decreased after applying top audit findings
